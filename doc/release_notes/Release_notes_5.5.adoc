* Add supporting standing order report

== Add supporting standing order report

From now on, it's possible to return standing order report on Get Transaction Status request(`GET /v1/accounts/{{account_id}}/transactions`) in JSON format.
Connector will return mocked data in the response for this request.

This endpoint is offering a list of all standing orders related to a dedicated payment account ion case of `bookingStatus` parameter equals `information`.
To support the `information` feature is optional for the ASPSP. Error code if not supported.
The query parameters `dateFrom`, `dateTo`, `withBalance`, `deltaList` and `entryReferenceFrom` will be ignored and have no effect on the
result.

In the accept header the `application/JSON` header must be supported, since the standing order report is supported in JSON only within this specification.
